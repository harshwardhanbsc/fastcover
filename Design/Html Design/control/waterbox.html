			<p>Stay hydrated to avoid heaststroke but don't drink the tap water al all costs. Bali's water is still 
			of questionable quality and drinking it can lead to traveller's diarrhoea (Bali Belly). Buy bottled water 
			instead which is available in restaurants and shops. If you're buying water from smaller shops check the 
			seal hasn't been tampered with before drinking. Hotels and villas will usually stock your room with bottled water. 
			Use it for brushing your teeth too.</p>
			<p>If you have to drink the tap water boil it for at least fime minutes before drinking.</p>
