    	<p>Taxis are the most common form of transport for tourists. The most trusted taxis are from the Bluebird Taxi 
		Company. Unfortunately there are other taxi drivers where safety is and issue. Operators cut costs wherever 
		possible resulting in poor vehicle maintenance, rough suspension, and bald tyres.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Look for the trusted pale blue taxis from the bluebird taxi company which has a large flooet of 500 late model vehicles.</li>
			<li>Make sure the driver speaks English well enough for you to understand.</li>
			<li>Check that the driver displays his photo ID card and has his meter on before you agree to the ride.</li>
			<li>Be prepared to pay a 6,000 Rupiah flat fall[AUD o.6oc] and up to 6,000 Rupiah for every kilometre after that.</li>
			<li>Females should be wary if travelling alone at night. Keep your wits about you and make note of the taxi number.</li>
